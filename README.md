This simple force-directed graph shows Twitter interactions between US senators and presidents. A physical simulation of charged particles and springs places politicians with regular Twitter mentions in closer proximity, while less-communicative politicians are farther apart. Layout algorithm inspired by [Tim Dwyer](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~tdwyer/) and [Thomas Jakobsen](http://web.archive.org/web/20080410171619/http://www.teknikus.dk/tj/gdc2001.htm).

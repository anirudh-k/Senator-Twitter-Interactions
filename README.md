This simple force-directed graph shows Twitter interactions between US senators and presidents. A physical simulation of charged particles and springs places politicians with regular Twitter mentions in closer proximity, while less-communicative politicians are farther apart. Each node represents a politician's Twitter handle, with blue ones being Democrats and red ones being Republicans (light blue is President Obama and dark red is President Trump).

Tweets were parsed for mentions (a Tweet that contains another person's @username anywhere in the body of the Tweet). Since the body of a Retweet mentions the original tweet's poster, Retweets also count as mentions. For each politician, I calculated the number of times s/he was mentioned by another politicians' Tweets. So suppose that @Sen_JoeManchin tweeted at @SenMikeLee 3 times, and @SenMikeLee tweeted at @Sen_JoeManchin 2 times. The weight of the edge between nodes @Sen_JoeManchin and @SenMikeLee would be 3+2=5. This produced a very dense graph, with 102 nodes (100 senators and 2 presidents) and 3123 edges.
